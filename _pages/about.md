I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). I am looking for self-motivated students on research projects in wireless networking and mobile computing. Please check my past papers to get a general understanding of my research style and check [Notes to the Prospective Students](https://renjiezhao.github.io/notes_to_students). 

My research interests are centered around wireless networking and mobile computing, with a particular focus on next-generation wireless network architectures (5G millimeter-wave, 6G joint communication and sensing, Internet of Things), novel radio hardware and software design (software-defined radio, wireless brain interfaces, low-power ultra-wide-band) and ubiquitous communication and sensing systems (smart homes, virtual/augmented reality, localization, ultra-reliable RFID for supply chains).

I have published in several top conferences, including ACM SIGCOMM, MobiCom, and USNIEX NSDI. In recognition of my work on massive MIMO millimeter-wave software radio, I was awarded the Best Paper Award at ACM MobiCom 2020. My work on this project has also been highlighted by ACM GetMobile, the top pick of the ACM SIGMOBILE area.

I received the M.S. degree (2020) and Ph.D. degree (2023) at [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) Department in [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), advised by Professor [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu).
I received my B.E. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018, where I worked on Backscatter Communications with Professor [Xiaohua Tian](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/) and Professor [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).
